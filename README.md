Here is a clear and concise description of your code written in STM32CubeIDE for the Nucleo-F446RE board:

üìù Code Description
This program runs on the Nucleo-F446RE development board and demonstrates basic GPIO input/output control. It uses the internal clock (HSI) as the system clock and configures SysTick for system timing. The main functionality is to turn on an LED connected to PA5 when a button connected to PC13 is pressed.

üîß Key Features and Setup
Clock Configuration:
The internal high-speed oscillator (HSI) is enabled.
The system clock source is switched to HSI.
SysTick is initialized to match the current core frequency.

GPIO Configuration:
PA5 is configured as an output push-pull pin for the LED.
PC13 is configured as an input with pull-up for the push button.

Main Loop Behavior:
Continuously reads the state of the button.
If the button is pressed (PIN_LOW), the LED on PA5 is turned ON.
If the button is released, the LED is turned OFF.
